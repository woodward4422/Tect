 Routing is under development. The route model contains the route components: The start and end point, the overall route distance, the duration using the chosen vehicle(s), the actual route components (routeLegs) containing the route geometry and actions (shifts, turns, climbs etc.) performed to get to the destination point. Typically this object is not manually instantiated, but returns as a result from a routing provider (MPRoutingProvider).
