#  Configuring the sample app

Before the MapsIndoors sample app is ready for use, a few things needs to be configured:
1. [Optional] The app is configured to use sample MapsIndoors data.  If you wish to use your own MapsIndoors data, you must change the MapsIndoors API Key in mapsIndoors.plist
2. [Required] Change the apps bundle ID to something unique.
3. [Required] Setup a Google API Key in mapsindoors.plist.  To create a Google API Key go to the Google Developer Console.
4. [Optional] To enable tracking analytics, create a GoogleService-Info.plist on the Google Developer Console, and add it to the MapsIndoors GitHub App target.
